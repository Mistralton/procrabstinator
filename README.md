Procrabstinator is an application extension that aims to provide users with the tools to understand and combat procrastination habits. By inputting due dates and deadlines, Procrabstinator sends notifications ranging from periodic reminders to pop-ups when opening "distracting" applications. The app also tracks the user's history of completing deadlines and provides personalized data on procrastination habits.

Procrabstinator is built with Tauri, utilizing a Next.js UI and a Rust, SQLite, and Axum back-end. The project also includes a browser extension for
Chromium and Firefox browsers, as well as a landing page built with Astro. With Procrabstinator, take control of your productivity and achieve your goals.

## Future Prospects

Some future prospects we have will be to implement deadline types so that itâ€™ll be possible to implement a filter feature to find certain deadlines easier. We also plan to make it compatible with more operating systems as well.
